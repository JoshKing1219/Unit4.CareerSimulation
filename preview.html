      Likely one of the exceptionally few conspiracy theories that could be
      true, a great number of Americans believed that the Central Intelligence
      Agency (CIA) assassinated the 35th President, John F. Kennedy. Theorists
      believe that the United States Government ordered the assassination
      because of a wide range of reasons all boiling down to one fact: he was
      too progressive. JFK was largely anti-war despite serving at the height of
      the Cold War and engaging in foreign military conflicts. Kennedy's
      anti-war stance, especially in Vietnam, led to a growing gap between him
      and the Warmongers in D.C. It is because of this conflict of interest that
      a great number of Americans to this day still believe this theory. This
      theory is also further supported by Lyndon B. Johnson's succession into
      the Presidency, and his largely unpopular warmongering tactics among the
      American People, following Kennedy's assassination. While there may be
      evidence to support this theory it is important to remember that
      everything online should be taken with a grain of salt.

      Swept up in the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the United States of
      America funneled pools of funding into space exploration in an effort to
      beat the Soviets to the Moon. Eventually the United States managed to beat
      the Soviets and landed the first man on the moon. However, conspiracy
      theorists believe that NASA and the U.S. Government staged the moon
      landing footage in order to bolster public morale and induce a wave of
      Nationalism in the American people. They further support this theory by
      claiming that the United States never had the financial resources to
      travel to the Moon and had to stage the landing so as to not permanently
      damage the faith the American People had in the Government as well as NASA
      & Space Exploration. While there is no evidence to support this theory, a
      great number of Americans still cling to it.

      A Nazi expedition to Antarctica in 1938-39, coupled with storiess of Nazi
      interest in occultism, led the German public to believe that Nazi Germany
      had a secret base on the frozen continent during the Second World War. As
      early as the 1950s, rumors began to circulate within certain German
      political circles that recent UFO sightings were in fact Nazi
      super-weapons that were in development by the 3rd Reich in Antarctica.
      Continued sightings of UFOs lead many to believe that there were Nazi
      powers still in play in remote corners of the world. No evidence was ever
      found to support any of these claims.

      Famous for his I Have A Dream speech and his historic work with Civil
      Rights, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. Many conspiracy
      theorists do not believe the reports that were released regarding the
      assassination and instead believe that the Federal Bureau of Investigation
      (FBI) assassinated him. They believe the FBI did this in an attempt to
      further divide White and African Americans and install a new fear of
      Communism in the Nation. While it is unclear what theorists truly believe
      was the end-goal of the assassination, they hold true to this theory due
      to the FBI's Director at the time, J. Edgar Hoover, stating to the
      Attorney General that they had evidence of MLK being a secret member of
      the Communist party. There is no true evidence to support their theory and
      J. Edgar Hoover's reason for slandering MLK can be simplified to racism
      and possible sexual identity supression.

      One of the most popular modern conspiracy theories, a fair number of
      American People believe that the Semptember 11th Terrorist Attack on the
      World Trade Center was not the work of Al-Queda terrorists but instead the
      work of the U.S. Government and 43rd President, George W. Bush. While this
      theory intially started as a meme created by late Millenials and early Gen
      Z, it caught fire and caused many Americans to truly believe that
      President Bush was behind the attack in order to gain public approval to
      start a war with the Middle East. The 9/11 Terrorist Attacks cost nearly
      3000 Americans their life and while it is still a tragedy, many Americans
      have lost faith in their Government which has caused more citizens to
      believe this theory each year. There is no evidence to support the belief
      that the U.S. Government would carry out an act of terrorism against it's
      own citizens to justify a war with a foreign power.

      By far one of the most outlandish conspiracy theories to emerge within the
      past 5 years, some theorists believe that a secret international
      organization of politicians and billionaires orchestrated the COVID-19
      Pandemic in an effort to gain more control over the citizens of various
      first-world nations. These theorists believe that this secret organization
      fueled the media, primarily in Europe and the United States, with false
      data to trick the masses into panicking and listening to anything their
      government tells them to do. The theorists further support their beliefs
      with the claim that mass shutdowns and mandatory isolation made people
      more submissive and easier to control. Some theorists have referred to the
      COVID-19 Quarantine as the biggest social experiment in history. While the
      full truth about COVID-19 may be hidden from the public, there is
      certainly no evidence to support any claims made by this theory.

      A great many people believe that the elitists and world leaders of the
      world are actually Lizard People. Yes, you read that correctly. Theorists
      actually believe that the wealthiest and most powerful people are in fact
      reptilian-humanoid hybrids who are part of a Cabal to consolidate power
      and control the Human Beings of Earth. Many conspiracy theorists support
      their belief in this theory based on wild claims that global elites have
      been spotted in their reptilian form or simply don't speak like normal
      people. It is incredibly important to understand that Lizard People do not
      exist and there is no proof supporting any of their irrational claims.

      Whether it be satire or just blind belief, there are an astonishing number
      of people that believe the Earth is not round but flat. Theorists believe
      that NASA and othe global elites have doctored footage and images of the
      Earth from space to make people believe that the Earth is round. Modern
      Flat Earth Theory originated in 1956 when Samuel Shenton set up the Flat
      Earth Society as a direct descendant to the original society that was
      founded in 1893. While it is unclear why modern Flat Earthers believe that
      countless sources would lie about Earth's sphericity, it is important to
      note that the Flat Earth theory was originally an archaic belief to better
      explain Earth's shape that has been disproven for centuries.

      The 1999 blockbuster The Matrix was a Sci-Fi film centered around the
      concept of a dystopian future where the Human Race is unknowingly
      harvested of their energy by intelligent machines while they are trapped
      inside of a simulated reality. Conspiracy theorists took this film to
      heart and believe that the concept of the movie is real and that the world
      we experience daily is nothing more than a simulated reality. There is no
      evidence that supports that theory and belief in such concepts border on
      delusion.

      Some conspiracy theorists believe that Earth's Moon was crafted by an
      alien civilization to house an alien creature within it. They believe that
      one day the Moon's crust will crack and the creature will hatch from it
      and devour the Earth. There has been seismic observations and other data
      that has been collected from the Moon that does in fact prove that this
      theory is far from the truth.
